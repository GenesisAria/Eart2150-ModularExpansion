|| There are a great many changes to gameplay!
A lot of it will be relatively apparent or not difficult to figure out, but i will cover some stuff that may be less obvious but very useful to know
<br>＊ this mod is not meant to be perfectly balanced


New units/buildings

\>UCS
<br>Grizzly (ship turret slots+)
<br>Truck 150mm C (medium range artillery)
<br>Minesweeper (fast mine clearer)

\>ED
<br>Heavy Tank (ship turret slot)
<br>Super Tank (120mm autocannon, long range anti-air rockets, and suicide bomb bay)
<br>Minesweeper (fast mine clearer, with tiny radar)

\>LC
<br>Prototype (heavy turret)
<br>Lightning walls (electric weapon)
<br>UFO
<br><br>

various not-so-obvious changes and notes:

＊ expect a lot of weapon range and damage changes

- builders are amphibious now
- each faction has a t2 ammo supplier
- all factions can build air container hooks to help ed ally
- volga can fit repairers and container fork
- nests can equip detector and regen
- salamander fits building turret
- navy ships can be transported via air
- lc can put a repairer on newhope for upgrade & capture (weak repair)
<br>

- screamers are no longer radars (ed can build a large radar on krus after research)
- ed supply depot and shipyard have modest radar (same as tier1 radar building, radar model existing on building as visual cue)
- lc ai builds sdi instead of weather controller, lc sdi has modest radar

＊ building changes are to blance out shadow vs bases.  ai ucs makes plenty of radar units
<br>＊ this makes ucs the king of in-field radar saturation, instead of ed
<br>
<br>

- ed sdi fire rate reduced, more ammo
- ucs sdi fire rate reduced, more ammo, is now self-powered and faster build
- lc sdi much more ammo, fast fire rate, very slow turret rotation
<br>

- all aircraft adjusted range/speed/armour (heavy ed = range, heavy ucs = speed/armour)
- bombers are now the transports (weaker but faster)
<br>

- aa plasma much faster and has small aoe damage
<br>

- ucs navy has speed advantage, especially in deep water, to counteract ed navy range dominance
<br>

- minesweepers are amphibious (ucs/ed)
- 150mm short range artillery truck is amphibious (ucs)
<br>

- sonic is now shield bypass
<br>

- artillery emplacements modified to be unique per faction (damage and aoe)

<br>
rebalanced audio<br>
<br>
more consistent unit targeting/firing<br>
<br>
and many more changes!
